# ZFM â€“ Personal Finance Management App

ZFM is a personal finance management application built with **Flutter**.  
It helps track income, expenses, and savings, following the **50/30/20 budgeting principle**.

---

## Overview

ZFM allows users to:
- Manage spending categories dynamically (by group or type)
- Follow a default budgeting configuration (50% Needs, 30% Wants, 20% Savings)
- Add, edit, and delete spending categories
- Track total income and expenses
- View the remaining balance and average daily spending
- Store data locally without requiring backend sync

---

## Features

- **Dynamic configuration:** Create or modify categories and budgeting rules.
- **Local storage:** Uses Hive for fast, lightweight local persistence.
- **50/30/20 default rule:** Built-in configuration for needs, wants, and savings.
